In response to the growing global demand for wetland data, and building on SEI-Latin America’s previous work, this project aims to develop the WetSAT-ML (Wetlands flooding extent and trends using SATellite observations and Machine Learning) tool. It consists of an open-source algorithm integrated with Google Earth Engine’s cloud platform and databases. The tool will process radar satellite data from the Sentinel-1 mission to generate wetland flooding extent maps, water permanence maps, and quantify key hydrological parameters, including flooded area time series, hydroperiods, and intra- and inter-annual wetland area trends.

## Installation

You can install the development version of WETSAT from [GitHub](https://github.com/), using these commands:

```{r eval=FALSE, include=TRUE}
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("dazamora/WETSAT")
```

## Concepts behind WETSAT tool


## WETSAT tool functions

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}

## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
# plot(pressure)
```

## Datasets
```{r fig.2, echo=FALSE, fig.align= "center", fig.height=1, fig.width=6, dpi = 600}
par(mar=c(0.6,0.6,0.6,0.6)+0.1)
plot(0,0, yaxt = "n", xaxt = "n", type = "n",bty= "n", ylab = "", xlab = "")
text(0,0, labels = expression(italic(paste(frac("ET","P")," = ", "1 + ", frac("PET","P"), 
                                           " - ", bgroup("[",1 - bgroup("(",frac("PET", "P"), ")")^(frac(1,1+alpha)), "]")^(1+alpha), "  [eq.2]", sep =""))), 
     cex = 0.9)
```
