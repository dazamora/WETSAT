abstract = {Abstract The ICESat-2 and GEDI missions were launched in 2018, becoming the new generation of space-borne laser altimeters. These missions provide unprecedented global geodetic elevations, opening great opportunities for water level monitoring. The potential of these altimeters has been demonstrated in open-water environments such as lakes, rivers, and reservoirs. However, detailed evaluations in vegetated environments, such as wetlands, floodplains, and other areas not constrained by water canal networks, are essential for continued improvement and further hydrological application. We developed a systematic accuracy assessment of ICESat-2 ATL08, and GEDI L2A products to monitor spatial-temporal water level and depth dynamics over the South Florida Everglades wetlands. The evaluation was performed on data acquired between 2020 and 2021, using gauge-based water level and depth estimates as references. The results showed an RMSE of 0.17 m (water level) and 0.15 m (water depth) for ICESat-2 and 0.75 m (water level) and 0.37 m (water depth) for GEDI. The analysis suggested that nighttime acquisitions were more accurate for both missions than daytime ones. The low-power beams achieved slightly higher accuracies than those of the high-power beams over the evaluated wetlands. Water level retrieval was more problematic in densely vegetated areas; however, we derived a correction model based on the leaf area index that improved the accuracy by up to 75\% for water depth retrievals from GEDI. Furthermore, the analysis provides new insights to understand the potential of the altimeters in monitoring the spatial-temporal dynamics of water levels in the evaluated wetlands.},

abstract = {Abstract Monitoring water level changes is necessary to manage, conserve and restore natural, and anthropogenic lake systems. However, the in-situ monitoring of lake systems is unfeasible due to limitations of costs and access. Furthermore, current remote sensing methods are restricted to large lakes and low spatial resolutions. We develop a novel approach using subsequential pixel-wise observations of the Sentinel-1B sensor based on interferometric synthetic aperture radar to detect water level changes in small lakes. We used 24 small ungauged lakes of the Cajas Massif lake system in Ecuador for development and validation. We found Differential Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (DInSAR)-derived water level changes across lakes to be consistent with precipitation, capturing the peak of the wet seasons. Furthermore, accumulated water level changes could be explained by differences in lake area among lakes. Although with limitations, this study shows the underutilized potential of DInSAR to understand water level changes in small lakes with current radar data availability.},

abstract = {Satellite remote sensing plays an important role in mapping the location and extent of surface water. A variety of approaches are available for mapping surface water, but deep learning approaches are not commonplace as they are ‘data hungry’ and require large amounts of computational resources. However, with the availability of various satellite sensors and rapid development in cloud computing, the remote sensing scientific community is adapting modern deep learning approaches. The new integration of cloud-based Google AI platform and Google Earth Engine enables users to deploy calculations at scale. In this paper, we investigate two methods of automatic data labeling: 1. the Joint Research Centre (JRC) surface water maps; 2. an Edge-Otsu dynamic threshold approach. We deployed a U-Net convolutional neural network to map surface water from Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data and tested the model performance using different hyperparameter tuning combinations to identify the optimal learning rate and loss function. The performance was then evaluated using an independent validation data set. We tested 12 models overall and found that the models utilizing the JRC data labels showed a better model performance, with F1-scores ranging from 0.972 to 0.986 for the training test and validation efforts. Additionally, an independently sampled high-resolution data set was used to further evaluate model performance. From this independent validation effort we observed models leveraging JRC data labels produced F1-Scores ranging from 0.9130.922. A pairwise comparison of models, through varying input data, learning rates, and loss functions constituents, revealed the JRC Adjusted Binary Cross Entropy Dice model to be statistically different than the 66 other model combinations and displayed the highest relative evaluations metrics including accuracy, precision score, Cohen Kappa coefficient, and F1-score. These results are in the same range as many of the conventional methods. We observed that the integration of Google AI Platform into Google Earth Engine can be a powerful tool to deploy deep-learning algorithms at scale and that automatic data labeling can be an effective strategy in the development of deep-learning models, however independent data validation remains an important step in model evaluation.}

ABSTRACT = {Accurately quantifying surface water extent in wetlands is critical to understanding their role in ecosystem processes. However, current regional- to global-scale surface water products lack the spatial or temporal resolution necessary to characterize heterogeneous or variable wetlands. Here, we proposed a fully automatic classification tree approach to classify surface water extent using Sentinel-1 synthetic aperture radar (SAR) data and training datasets derived from prior class masks. Prior classes of water and non-water were generated from the Shuttle Radar Topography Mission (SRTM) water body dataset (SWBD) or composited dynamic surface water extent (cDSWE) class probabilities. Classification maps of water and non-water were derived over two distinct wetlandscapes: the Delmarva Peninsula and the Prairie Pothole Region. Overall classification accuracy ranged from 79% to 93% when compared to high-resolution images in the Prairie Pothole Region site. Using cDSWE class probabilities reduced omission errors among water bodies by 10% and commission errors among non-water class by 4% when compared with results generated by using the SWBD water mask. These findings indicate that including prior water masks that reflect the dynamics in surface water extent (i.e., cDSWE) is important for the accurate mapping of water bodies using SAR data.},

ABSTRACT = {The Polarimetric Synthetic Aperture Radar technique has provided various opportunities and challenges in agricultural activities mainly on crop management. The aim of this study is to investigate the sensitivity of 10 parameters derived from multi-temporal Sentinel-1 Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) data, to crop height and canopy coverage (CC) of maize, sunflower, and wheat. The correlation coefficient values indicate a high correlation for maize during the early growing stage. The coefficient determinations (R2) of 0.82 and 0.81 indicate that there is a strong relationship between the maize height and SAR parameters including VV + VH and VV, respectively. The maize CC is well correlated with VV parameter (R2 = 0.73), but it is observed that at the later growing stage the correlation became weaker. This means that the sensitivity decreases with increasing vegetation cover growth. Compared to maize, the sensitivity of SAR parameters to wheat variables is often good at the early stage. However, the highest correlation with wheat height represented by Alpha (α) decomposition parameter (R2 = 0.67). The sunflower height has an insignificant correlation with the majority of SAR parameters and only VH polarization shows low sensitivity (R2 = 0.31). The sunflower CC shows relatively higher correlation with VV polarization (R2 = 0.46) at the early stage while no considerable correlation is observed at the later stage. It is found that Sentinel-1 has a high potential for estimation of crop height and CC of the maize as a broad-leaf crop. The same is not true for sunflower as another broad-leaf crop.},
